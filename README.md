# DQN-CollectBananas
Agent for solving the Unity "Banana" Environment

## Introduction
This is all about a Reinforcement Learning problem. In square world an agent hast to collect yellow bananas for which he gets a reward of +1. But there are also blue bananas. If the agent runs into one of these he gets a reward of -1.
The goal is to get a score as high as possible.

## Installation
An installation manual for Windows (contains also links for Linux - installation)  
https://github.com/reinforcement-learning-kr/pg_travel/wiki/Installing-Unity-ml-agents-on-Windows

## The Environment
The environment is an adpated version of https://youtu.be/heVMs3t9qSk and is a project of the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning nanodegree. The Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip file offers this environment.

## Getting started
Follow the instraction in the jupyter notebook BananaCollector-main.ipynb.

## Possible improvements
- intensive hyperparameter tuning
- a deeper neural network
- other technics like double DQN, dueling DQN, prioritizied experience replay
